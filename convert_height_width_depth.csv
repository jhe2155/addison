The Jusserand Medal was instituted in 1924 by Council to acknowledge the best work on international intellectual progress, in particular vis-�-vis relations between the United States and Europe. The medal was established to honor Jean Jules Jusserand, French ambassador to the United States and President of the American Historical Association in 1921. Although intended as an annual award, it became an occasional offering first given in 1925 and then in 1930, 1932, 1933, and 1937. The Jusserand Medal was discontinued by Council in 1938.

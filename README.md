# Addison 

Data visualization of dataset of pieces from the [Addison Gallery of American Art] (https://addison.andover.edu/Pages/default.aspx). The following steps were conducted: 

- convert length, width dimensions of each art piece to decimal form (in inches) 
- seperate data into 6 time-separated datasets 
- perform Kmeans clustering with 6 clusters 

The dimensions of the centers of each cluster over time were laser cut and then placed on a cardboard timeline.
